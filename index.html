        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, we build on top of the image rendering results from Proj 3-1 to create more cool visual lighting effects.
            We completed parts 1 and 4 of this project. In part 1, we implemented reflection and refraction of light, and use these 
            to create mirror, refracting, and glass materials. In part 4, we implemented thin-lens camera model which allows us 
            to change focus by changing lens radius and/or focal distance.
        </p >

                <li>
                    From m=1 to m=2: Both balls can reflect light, but there is no refraction with the glass ball.

                <li>
                    From m=2 to m=3: Refraction begins within the glass ball.

                <li>
                    From m=3 to m=4: There appears to be a focused light point on the right wall. Looks like this is due to reflection and 
                    refraction of the glass ball.
                </li>
                <li>

            <ul>
            <li>
                From m=0 to m=1: When m = 0, only the self-emitting object is bright since there is no ray traveling at all. When we increase the ray_depth from 0 to 1, surface that is directly illuminated shows up on the scene.
            </li>
            <li>
                From m=1 to m=2: An extra depth of ray here allows the reflective surface to reflect the light hit its surface. However, we can see the reflected scene on the reflective ball is the scene of the previous stage.
            </li>
            <li>
                From m=2 to m=3: Refraction effects starts to show up on the glass ball since ray needs two bounce to get into the glass ball and reflect back to the surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                From m=3 to m=4: With more bounces, light are more likely to be refracted into the glass ball, which then focus the light
                rays to a specific region on the wall , thereby forming the focused light point. 
            </li>
            <li>
                From m=4 to m=5: Light in the previous level again gets reflected by the glass and metal sphere, and then intersects
                with the environment, which makes the environment brighter. More light gets refracted through the glass ball and 
                arrive in the shadow area below the ball, which lits up the shadow. 
            </li>
            <li>
                From m=5 to m=100: With m = 5 there are already enough light being reflected / refracted to create a global illumination,
                so increasing the level from 5 to 100 will not do much in changing the visual appearance of the image. 
            </li>

        <p>
            With a pinhole camera model, all light goes through one point at the camera and travels in straight line. In this model, 
            everything is in focus. With a thin-lens camera model, lights are refracted and bent when it goes through the thin lens, 
            thereby creating a plane of focus. Everything that is not within this plane are not in focus.
